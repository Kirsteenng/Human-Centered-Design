### Goal of project
This project aims to explore the impact of mask mandate in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the rate of change of such confirmed cases in Macomb County, Michigan ranging from Feb 2020 to October 2022. The analysis begins with data manipulation to process the data into the format that is needed to plot the visualisations. Comments and explanation will be included in the notebook as markdown in order to guide the reader throughout the analysis.
